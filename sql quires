📄 SQL Queries Used in the Superstore Project and Their Purpose
This project uses basic SQL SELECT queries to analyse retail sales data from the Superstore dataset.
Each query serves a specific analytical purpose such as filtering, sorting, and identifying top-selling products.
________________________________________
1️⃣ Display All Records
SELECT * 
FROM superstore;
🔍 Meaning:
•	Retrieves all rows and all columns from the superstore table.
•	Used to verify that data was imported correctly.
________________________________________
2️⃣ Filter Products by Category (Technology)
SELECT *
FROM superstore
WHERE Category = 'Technology';
🔍 Meaning:
•	Filters the dataset to show only Technology products.
•	Demonstrates the use of the WHERE clause for row-level filtering.
________________________________________
3️⃣ Sort Technology Products by Sales
SELECT Product_Name, Sales
FROM superstore
WHERE Category = 'Technology'
ORDER BY Sales DESC;
🔍 Meaning:
•	Filters products belonging to Technology category
•	Sorts them by sales in descending order
•	Helps identify high-selling individual orders

4️⃣ Find Top 5 Technology Products by Total Sales
SELECT Product_Name, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM superstore
WHERE Category = 'Technology'
GROUP BY Product_Name
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
🔍 Meaning:
•	Groups records by product name
•	Calculates total sales per product
•	Sorts products by highest total sales
•	Displays the top 5 best-selling Technology products
________________________________________
5️⃣ Total Sales by Category
SELECT Category, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM superstore
GROUP BY Category;
🔍 Meaning:
•	Aggregates sales for each product category
•	Helps compare overall performance of categories
•	Uses GROUP BY with aggregate function SUM()
________________________________________
6️⃣ Profit by Region
SELECT Region, SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM superstore
GROUP BY Region;

WHERE Sales > 1000
ORDER BY Sales DESC;
🔍 Meaning:
•	Filters orders with sales greater than 1000
•	Sorts them from highest to lowest
•	Helps identify high-value transactions
________________________________________
8️⃣ Count Total Orders
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Order_ID) AS Total_Orders
FROM superstore;
🔍 Meaning:
•	Counts the number of unique orders
•	Gives an overview of order volume
________________________________________
9️⃣ Average Profit
SELECT AVG(Profit) AS Average_Profit
FROM superstore;
🔍 Meaning:

________________________________________
10️⃣ Customers with More Than 5 Orders
SELECT Customer_Name, COUNT(Order_ID) AS Order_Count

GROUP BY Customer_Name
HAVING COUNT(Order_ID) > 5;
🔍 Meaning:
•	Identifies frequent customers
•	Uses HAVING to filter grouped results
•	Helps in customer loyalty analysis


AS
The AS command is used to give a table or a column a temporary name.
When you use aggregations like SUM, the default header is often ugly (e.g., SUM(Sales)). Use AS to fix it.

The OR Operator
Only ONE of the conditions needs to be true. It expands your results.

Use Case: Find orders from either 'Kentucky' or 'California'.

Logical Operators: AND & OR
These are used in the WHERE clause to combine multiple conditions. They act as the "filters" for your data.

The AND Operator
All conditions must be TRUE for a row to be included. It narrows your results.

Use Case: Find sales that are both in the 'Technology' category and have a 'Sales' value greater than 500.
